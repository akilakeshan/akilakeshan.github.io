        <ol>
            <li>Step 1:Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour your cake pans.</li>
            <li>Step 2:In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 3:In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done with an electric mixer.  </li>
            <li>Step 4:Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.  </li>
            <li>Step 5:Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Alternate with additions of milk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to a dense cake.  </li>
            <li>Step 6:Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.  </li>
            <li>Step 7:Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The exact time may vary, so keep an eye on it.  </li>
            <li>Step 8:Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.  </li>
            <li>Step 9:Once the cakes are completely cooled, you can frost and decorate them as desired. You can use buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or any other frosting of your choice.  </li>
            <li>Step 10:Once the frosting is set, your cake is ready to be served! Enjoy your homemade cake.</li>
